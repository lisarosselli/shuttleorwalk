		<h3>Shuttlewalk is a Web App</h3>
			<p>Point your browser to <a href="http://shuttle.runninlatte.com">http://shuttle.runninlatte.com</a></p>
		<h3>You Will Be Geolocated</h3>
			<p>If your browser is capable, it will take a moment to geolocate you. If you are not successfully geolocated, or you not found on Harvard University campus, you will by default be placed at the Harvard Coop.</p>
		<h3>Where Are You Going?</h3>
			<p>Simply touch or click on the map to select a destination. Made a mistake? Touch/click to select a different destination</p>
		<h3>The Interface</h3>
			<p>Bring up the modal window interface by touch/click on the white circle button on the right. Dismiss it by touch/click the red arrow in the upper-right corner.</p>
		<h3>Calculate a Route!</h3>
			<p>Look to the right of your screen, see that white circle with the green arrow? Touch/click on it. That will open a small modal window consisting of 3 'views'. Read the first screen, then touch/click the button 'Ok, got it!'</p>
			<p>On this next view, touch/click 'Calculate Route'.</p>
			<p>You will be forwarded to the third and final view. Here you will see your route calculated. There will be information about how long it would take to walk versus how long your trip would take if you a) walked to the nearest stop, b) waited for (and rode) the shuttle, and c) then walked from the destination stop to your desired location.</p>
		<h3>Don't Know Where You Are Going?</h3>
			<p>Use the modal window's 3 circle buttons at the top to navigate to the middle view. Use the search box and begin typing in the name of your destination. Touch/click on any of the results that meet what you are looking for. Your destination will be set to that item.</p>
		<h3>Geolocation Not Working For You?</h3>
			<p>Bring up the modal window interface by touch/click on the white circle button on the right. Use the circle dot navigation at the top of the modal window to navigat to the middle view. Touch/click 'My geolocation is wrong. I'll place myself...' Your next touch/click will set your current location. Any touch/click after that will set your destination.</p>
